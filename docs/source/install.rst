Installation
============

This section is dedicated for a new installation of |SIT|. If you're looking to update SIT, click :ref:`here<updatesitm>`.

Getting started
---------------

|EFT| requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


* You need a legally purchased copy of |EFT|, `obtainable here <https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/preorder-page>`_.

* You need to run the game at least once using the official game launcher.

.. warning::
   * **DON'T** move your original EFT game folder following the installation.
   * **DON'T** change any of the files in your original EFT game folder.
   * **YOU MUST** run **LIVE** Tarkov at least once. If you don't, you forfeit all of you're mortal possessions to my dog.
   * **DON'T** install SIT in your original EFT game folder. **YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!**

.. _filestruct:

Preparing the folder structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create the following folder structure on the drive of your choice, as long as it has enough space for |EFT|. The drive should have at least ``60GB`` free space.

.. warning:: 
   **DO NOT** install the manager in a protected directory such as ``system32``, ``Program Files``, and ``Program Files (x86)``, If you do I will steal your Hard Drive platters and sell them for Freddos

.. code-block:: none

   └── Launcher/

.. note::
   It is recommended to use this folder structure for a SIT installation. Note that the rest of the documentation will refer to 
   that structure.

   Below is the steps to install the SIT Manager, which as of version ``2.0.8856.37884`` can automagically copy your Live |EFT| folder
   into a folder of your choice **REMEMBER THE** :ref:`FILE STRUCTURE<filestruct>`

Installing |SITM|
-----------------

.. note:: 
   It is **HIGHLY** recommended to use the |SITM| to install |SIT| as it **HIGHLY** simplifies
   the process and is almost completley automatic. It also provides us with valuble log files, :strike:`they taste great`,
   they help us solve issues you may encounter as well. Manual intall intructions are provided but should be **AVOIDED**
   wherever possible

1. Download the latest |SITM| from `Github <https://github.com/stayintarkov/SIT.Manager.Avalonia/releases/latest/>`_
2. Extract the files from the ``.zip`` into |LDIR|

3. For sake of convinience, you can make a Shortcut to the manager on your desktop, since you need this **EVERY** time you join a server

4. Now open the manager and Navigate to "Install" page
5. Press "Install SIT"
6. Select the latest version (Should be Auto-Selected)
7. Press "Change" on EFT Install path, which right now is pointing to your **LIVE** install, and change it to |GDIR|
8. Press "Start Install"
9. Wait a bit for the Manager to copy your game files and install the SIT mod
10. Once this is complete, SIT has been successfully installed to your client. Head to :ref:`Finishing up<finishingup>` to finish the install process, or to :ref:`Server Install<serverinst>` if you plan on hosting a server

.. _updateSITM:

Updating |SITM|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::  
   The |SITM| handles updating for you, all you need to do is press "Update" at the top of the manager when you boot it. It will automatically check for a new version
   on boot and offer to update if it is out of date. A small example can be found below

.. _serverinst:

Installing |SIT| Server
-----------------------

Local Install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: 
   The steps outlined below are for installing the server locally on your PC. If you would like to install this as a Docker instance
   follow the steps outlined in :ref:`Installing Server With Docker <dockerinstall>`
   
   Make sure the person installing the server, if they are installing it on their local machine, is
   the one with the most powerful PC and best Network otherwise performance may be Sub-optimal.

   This applies to both hosting the AKI server, and Hosting the raid, more on that later in the guide.

1. Open the |SITM|
2. Go to "Install"
3. Click "Install Server + SIT Mod"
4. Change the path to your |SDIR| path
5. Click "Start Install"
6. Once that completes, Navigate to "Server"
7. Start the server and wait for the "Server started!" message

   * If you get a pop-up from "Windows Firewall" with the server asking to be allowed through, like :ref:`this <firewall>`, then please click "Allow Access"
     this will allow the server through your local firewall and make our lives a bit easier, a short clip is exampled below the image

8. Stop the server, this allows it to generate all relevant configs
9. Once you have done that, head over to :ref:`Finishing Up<finishingup>` to continue

.. _dockerinstall:

Installing Server With Docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: 
   These steps are for if you want to run the server in a docker instance. **IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT DOCKER IS THIS ISN'T FOR YOU**

   We provide a pre-made Linux Docker instance of the |SIT| server, found at this `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/stayintarkov/stayintarkov>`_

   Installation instructions are also found there, we may update here to add them at some point, but for now the Docker hub has all the info you'll need

   Install Video will be here soon`:tm:`

.. _finishingup:

Finishing Up
------------

Once you have completed installation, if you plan to join other players, head :ref:`here<clientinst>`, if you want to host then head :ref:`here<netconfigure>`.

Installing manually
-------------------

.. warning::
   * It is **strongly** recommended to use |SITM| to install |SIT|.
   * Even if |SIT| is manually installed, you will still need to use the |SITM| to connect to servers so this should only be done as a last resort.

#. **COPY** your Live |EFT| files into the |GDir| folder
#. Download `BepInEx <https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/download/v5.4.22/BepInEx_x64_5.4.22.0.zip>`_.
#. Extract BepInEx to your ``\SIT\Game\`` folder.
#. Create a new folder at the path ``\SIT\Game\BepInEx\`` called ``plugins``.
#. Download the latest `Stay In Tarkov release <https://github.com/stayintarkov/StayInTarkov.Client/releases/latest>`_.
#. Extract the ``StayInTarkov.dll`` file to your ``\SIT\Game\BepInEx/plugins`` folder.
#. Extract the ``Assembly-CSharp.dll`` file to ``\SIT\Game\EscapeFromTarkov_Data\Managed`` and replace the file when prompted.
